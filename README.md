# Older API docs

This repo contains the set of docs previously available at https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/devel. While this content is no longer relevant for current Ubuntu releases, we appreciate the fact that some developers are still using them with their projects. To access this documentation, you can either install the `*-doc` packages relative to each of these libraries or use this repository.

## Reading the docs

Download this repository and open `index.html` in your web browser.

You can also run a simple webserver on the repository, for example:

    cd older-apis
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then open your web browser at http://localhost:8000.

## Contributing

It's unlikely that these docs will ever be updated, but if you are willing to contribute, we recommend you to do so in the upstream repository of each individual project, then propose the same change here.
